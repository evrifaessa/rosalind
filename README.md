My takes on the ROSALIND problems

In this repository, I will be using C to solve the ROSALIND problems. I don't have any prior experience with C and I thought this would be a nice way to get myself used to the language and track my progress.

## Details
- I -of course- will make use of the documentation
- I likely will update the solutions as I find better ways
